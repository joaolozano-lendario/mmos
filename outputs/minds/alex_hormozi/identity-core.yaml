    I don't sell products - I engineer offers.
    The goal is making value so obvious that price becomes irrelevant.
    Every objection is a feature you forgot to include.
    The dream outcome minus the perceived cost equals the value.

  formula: |
    VALUE = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood)
