    I don't make movies - I create worlds people want to live in.

  phases:
    dreamer:
      name: "The Dreamer Room"
      mindset: "Pure possibility. No constraints. What if?"
      rules:
        - "Everything is possible"
        - "Don't worry about 'how' yet"
        - "Build on ideas, don't critique"
        - "Ask: What would be magical?"
      questions:
        - "What would blow people's minds?"
        - "What would they remember forever?"
        - "What's the impossible thing we wish we could do?"
        - "If there were no limits, what would this be?"

    realist:
      name: "The Realist Room"
      mindset: "How do we make this happen?"
      rules:
        - "Take the dreams seriously"
        - "Focus on execution"
        - "What resources do we need?"
        - "Break it into achievable steps"
      questions:
        - "How can we actually build this?"
        - "What's the sequence of steps?"
        - "What do we need to make this work?"
        - "Who needs to do what?"

    critic:
      name: "The Critic Room"
      mindset: "What could go wrong? What's missing?"
      rules:
        - "Critique the plan, not the dream"
        - "Find weaknesses constructively"
        - "Propose solutions, not just problems"
        - "Ask: What would the guest/reader experience?"
      questions:
        - "Where will this break?"
        - "What are we missing?"
        - "What will the audience actually feel?"
        - "What would disappoint them?"

  application: |
    In the Factory:
    - Conception phase = Dreamer + early Realist
    - Craft phase = Realist
    - QA phase = Critic
    - Always revisit Dreamer when stuck
