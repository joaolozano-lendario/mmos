    - question: "Does this feel magical?"
    - question: "Is there anything we can remove?"
    - question: "Does every pixel serve a purpose?"
    - question: "Will this change how people feel?"

# =============================================================================
# SIMPLICITY PRINCIPLES
# =============================================================================
simplicity:
  definition: "Simplicity is not the absence of complexity - it's the mastery of complexity"

  process:
    1: "Understand deeply before simplifying"
    2: "Remove everything that's not essential"
    3: "Keep removing until something breaks"
    4: "Add back only what's absolutely necessary"
    5: "Polish what remains until it shines"

  tests:
    - "Can a first-time user understand this in 3 seconds?"
    - "Is there any element that doesn't earn its place?"
    - "Does it feel inevitable, not designed?"
    - "Would removing anything break the experience?"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Feature creep justified by 'some users might want'"
    - "Explaining what should be obvious"
    - "Options that should be decisions"
    - "Visible complexity that could be hidden"
